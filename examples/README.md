When adding a new API (entirely new API not a new version), increment the count found in static/data.json to match the number of total APIs. THIS IS IMPORTANT. Name the folder your new API is contained in to the next number above the highest existing folder number. Inside of the new API folder make sure to include a versioncount.json. The count entry in here should be the number of version folders you have (basically the same as the APIs folder system and count). An example structure can be found in static/examples if you need help.
